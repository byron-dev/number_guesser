# Number Guesser App to practice Vanilla JS

This Vanilla JS App was developed to practice some fundamentals following this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning)

The project was styled using [Skeleton CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/skeleton)

## Fundamentals Practiced
- Adding text to element with element.textContent
- Parsing strings to int with parseInt()
- Validate if a value is not a number is isNaN()
- Reload page using window.location.reload()
- Event Delegation to add listeners to elements that were not in the DOM when the page loaded
- Differentiating click and mousedown events
